				<h2>Albert Bifet — ACM Distinguished Speaker</h2>
				<h3>Title: IoT Massive Online Analytics</h3>
				<p><i><b>Abstract:</b></i>
Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to fundamentally shift the way we interact with our surroundings. The challenge of deriving insights from the Internet of Things (IoT) has been recognized as one of the most exciting and key opportunities for both academia and industry. Advanced analysis of big data streams from sensors and devices is bound to become a key area of data mining research as the number of applications requiring such processing increases. Dealing with the evolution over time of such data streams, i.e., with concepts that drift or change completely, is one of the core issues in stream mining. In this talk, I will present an overview of data stream mining, and I will introduce some popular open source tools for data stream mining. </br></br>

				<p><i><b>Biography:</b></i> Albert Bifet is a Full Professor and Head of the Data, Intelligence
and Graphs (DIG) Group at Télécom ParisTech and Honorary
				Research Associate at the WEKA Machine Learning Group at University of
				Waikato. Previously he worked at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab in Hong Kong,

				He is the author of a book on Adaptive Stream Mining and Pattern
				Learning and Mining from Evolving Data Streams. He is one of the

				<h2>Volker Markl</h2>
				<h3>Title: Mosaics in Big Data: Stratosphere, Flink and Beyond</h3>
				<p><i><b>Abstract:</b></i> The global database research community has greatly impacted
				the functionality and performance of data storage and processing systems
				along the dimensions that define “big data”, i.e., volume, velocity,
				variety, and veracity. Locally, over the past five years, we have also
				been working on varying fronts. Among our contributions are: (1)
				establishing a vision for a database-inspired big data analytics system,
				which unifies the best of database and distributed systems technologies,
				and augments it with concepts drawn from compilers (e.g., iterations)
				and data stream processing, as well as (2) forming a community of
				researchers and institutions to create the Stratosphere platform to
				realize our vision. One major result from these activities was Apache
				Flink, an open-source big data analytics platform and its thriving
				global community of developers and production users. Although much
				progress has been made, when looking at the overall big data stack, a
				major challenge for database research community still remains. That is,
				how to maintain the ease-of-use despite the increasing heterogeneity and
				complexity of data analytics, involving specialized engines for various
				aspects of an end-to-end data analytics pipeline, including, among
				others, graph-based, linear algebra-based, and relational-based
				algorithms, and the underlying, increasingly heterogeneous hardware and
				computing infrastructure. At TU Berlin, DFKI, and the Berlin Big Data
				Center (BBDC), we aim to advance research in this field via the Mosaics
				project. Our goal is to remedy some of the heterogeneity challenges that
				hamper developer productivity and limit the use of data science
				technologies to just the privileged few, who are coveted experts.

				<h2>Nesime Tatbul</h2>
				<h3>Title: New Challenges and Opportunities in Stream Processing: Transactions, Predictive Analytics, and Beyond</h3>
				<p><i><b>Abstract:</b></i>
				Stream processing has been an area of ongoing research since the
early 2000s. Fueled by industry’s growing interest in dealing with
high-velocity big data in near real-time settings, there has been a
resurgence of recent activity in both research and engineering of
large-scale stream processing systems. In this talk, we will examine
the state of the art, focusing in particular on key trends of the past
five years with an outlook towards the next five years. I will also
give examples from our own work, including stream processing in
transactional settings as well as predictive time series analytics for
the Internet of Things.
Transactional stream processing broadly refers to processing
streaming data with correctness guarantees. These guarantees include
not only properties that are intrinsic to stream processing
(e.g., order, exactly-once semantics), but also ACID properties of
traditional OLTP-oriented databases, which arise in streaming applications
with shared mutable state. In our recent work, we have
designed and built the S-Store System, a scalable main-memory system
that supports hybrid OLTP+streaming workloads with strict
correctness needs. A use case that best exemplifies the strengths
of S-Store is real-time data ingestion. Thus, I will also discuss the
requirements of modern data ingestion and how to meet them using
S-Store, especially within the context of our BigDAWG Polystore
System.
The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions a world made up of huge
numbers of sensors and computing devices that interact in intelligent
ways (e.g., self-driving cars, industrial automation, mobile
phone tracking). The sensors produce massive amounts of data and
the computing devices must figure out how to use it. The preponderance
of this data is time series. Anomaly detection, i.e., the process
of finding patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, over
time series is an important capability in IoT with multiple potential
applications. Through anomaly detection, we can identify unusual
environmental situations that need human attention, distinguish
outliers in sensor data cleaning, or pre-filter uninteresting portions
of data to preserve computing resources, to name a few. In our new
Greenhouse Project, we have been exploring “zero-positive” 1 machine
learning (ML) techniques for efficient and accurate prediction
of anomalous patterns over high volumes of time series data.
This also includes the design of a new accuracy model for evaluating
range-based anomaly detection algorithms more effectively.
I will share some of our early results from this project, and then
conclude the talk with a discussion of future research directions.</p>

				<h2>Eibe Frank</h2>
				<h3>Title: WEKA: Teaching an Old Bird New Tricks</h3>
				<p><img src="../images/Eibe.jpg" alt="Picture of Eibe Frank" class="pull-left">
				<i><b>Abstract:</b></i>
				
				
				This invited talk will provide an overview of the WEKA project, a software development effort at Waikato university that has spanned more than 15 years. 
The project has produced an open-source software workbench for machine learning and data mining that is written in Java and incorporates several graphical user interfaces, a command-line interface, and an API. 
The talk will focus on some of the more recent additions to the software that have enabled integration of other tools from the software ecosystem for data science: R, Python, and DeepLearning4j, a deep learning library written in Java.
